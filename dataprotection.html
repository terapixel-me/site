    <h1 class="mt-5">terrapixel - privacy statement</h1>
    <p class="lead">every good (european?) website need to have a privacy statement. ok, than let's make it short</p>
    <h3>preamble</h3>
    <p>Article 12 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that I explain to you
      "in a precise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form [and] in clear and simple language"
      what is happening here on this website.
      Since I cannot assume that you have studied computer science, law or rocket engineering for five years,
      I shall write plain text here. Yeah I'm happy to do that.</p>
    <h3>who is reponsible for the data-processing</h3>
    <p>I guess that's me. My name is Bennet Becker and you can contact me via e-mail: imprint@bennet.cc</p>
    <p>You don't need to know my physical address in order to be able to contact me. But if you really want to be source
      you can send me a "<a href="https://www.deutschepost.de/de/e/epost.html">E-POST</a> Letter" to my
      "<a href="https://www.deutschepost.de/de/e/epost.html">E-POST</a> address" bennet.becker@epost.de
      which is a bad mix between e-mail and normal mail.</p>
    <h3>hosting a.k.a. where the data goes</h3>
    <p>The part of the website you see, is served by Cloudflare. This is a US company with servers all over the world.
      Your access to this website will almost certainly be stored in the US. I have no contract with them for third-party
      data processing, because understanding their lenghty standard contracts is almost impossible without an expensive lawyer.</p>
    <p>When accessing the page the following data is tansmitted
      <ul>
        <li>Your IP address</li>
        <li>The time when you accessed the page</li>
        <li>the full link of the page you accessed</li>
        <li>information shared by your brower. commonly including the brower used and it version and the OS you are on a the corresponding version</li>
      </ul>
      This data is transmitted so that they are able to process your request and serve the correct content. And they store the data for security and analytics purposed later.
    </p>
    <p>The Cloudflare service is used, because lets face it, I don't even remotely have the resources to serve literal terrabytes of image data in any efficent way</p>
    <p>Occsionally Cloudflare forwards your request to backend servers. This occours if cloudflare happens to not have cached the site you are currently requesting.
     The backend with the mainpage an documentation, is hosted by 1and1 IONOS in Germany. The backend for the tiling image(s) is hosted by Hetzner in Germany. If Cloudflare
     decides to forward the requests there, they will see all the same information as mentioned above.</p>
    <h3>thrid party content</h3>
    <p>The website includes third-party content from <i>stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com</i>, <i>code.jquery.com</i>, <i>cdn.jsdelivr.net</i> and <i>unpkg.com</i> for styking purposes.
      These third-party CDNs might also log your access and in addition to the data above, also the information that you accessed them via this site is transmitted.</p>
    <h3>analytics and tracking</h3>
    <p>The website does <b>not</b> use any trackers like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, Piwik, ... . The project is just for fun, so why should care about analytics.
      But non the less, Cloudflare analyses the traffic, listing it by country of origin, that goes through them and this is not something that can be switched of.</p>
    <h3>cookies</h3>
    <p>You know what a cookie is? No? Ok, you can read about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">here</a>. Some people are afraid of cookies because they think you can tell if they (those people with the fear) were on a porn site last night or have a secret fetisch of some kind. That's why hardly anyone wants a website to store cookies. De facto, however, it is the case that websites hardly function today without cookies. And as long as only first party cookies are used, this is not possible with the tracking of fetisch porn sites. This website certainly also uses cookies - but only the "good" first-party cookies. Third party cookies have at least not been deliberately integrated into this website.</p>
    <h3>contact</h3>
    <p>Now for contact: If you send me an e-mail, you have to live with the fact that I receive data from you. I will then see your e-mail address, possibly also your IP address, and if I make a good effort and evaluate the X-header of your e-mail manually, I may even be able to see the name of the computer from which you wrote the message. This is not magic or hacker art, but an Internet standard. If you can read it, you will get this data. This is due to technical reasons - and has been the case for many years. If you send me your data unsolicited, you can assume that I protect your e-mail just as well or badly as all my other e-mails. If at any time you decide that I should delete the e-mail you sent me without being asked, you may politely ask me to do so - but I promise nothing. Again, if you can't live with it, please don't send me an e-mail.</p>
    <h3>data retention</h3>
    <p>Cloudflare and the other CDNs keep this data as long as they require it to fullfill their purposes. You would need to consult their respecting privacy statement for more information</p>
    <h3>your rights</h3>
    <p>Accoding to Art. 15 GDPR, I'm required to tell you, that you have the right to get get your data delete or correted in case you wish to do so. But as I don't have any of the data
    and I have no option to selectivly delte data in the cloudflare interface, I would kindly ask you go to Cloudflare with this desire.</p>
    <p>Additionally you have also the right to send a complain to the data protection authority about me. But I would kindly ask you to contact me first if you feel there are any
      problems regarding privacy here</p>
